-name it something better
-give it a better icon
-align text? maybe?
-venue based coli stats rather than general enemies fought and chests obtained
-pickling warning
  -could just move to CSVs instead to avoid pickling, only issue is it would require a massive rewrite and old .dat files would be incompatible
   -good opportunity to make a conversion tool to convert .dats into .csvs!
